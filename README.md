# superconpy: Superconductors Critical Temperature Prediction

## Abstract

This repository contains the code and data for the paper titled "Interpretably learning the critical temperature of superconductors: Electron concentration and feature dimensionality reduction". The paper proposes a machine learning model for predicting the critical temperature of novel superconductors, focusing on ab initio features directly related to electronic and atomic information. By incorporating electron concentration and electronegativity, the learning dimensionality is significantly reduced while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The study provides valuable insights into the influence of specific atomic orbitals on the electron concentration and offers interpretability in the learning process.
